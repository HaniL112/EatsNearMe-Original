# EatsNearMe-Original
What if there was an app that could tell you the latest and hottest deals for food services anywhere you go?
EatsNearMe is a mobile application that does just that. With EatsNearMe, users will be able to see all deals
and discounts within close proximity to their location. 

EatsNearMe was created at Hack The Valley 4 by Hani L., Arhum W., Raphael K., and Nathan H.
